## Evolutionary processing : Genetic Algorithms
A genetic algorithm (GA) is a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems based on a natural selection process that mimics biological evolution.



## Notion of Natural Selection
The process of natural selection starts with the selection of fittest individuals from a population. They produce offspring which inherit the characteristics of the parents and will be added to the next generation. If parents have better fitness, their offspring will be better than parents and have a better chance at surviving. This process keeps on iterating and at the end, a generation with the fittest individuals will be found.
This notion can be applied for a search problem. 

We consider a set of solutions for a problem and select the set of best ones out of them.
Five phases are considered in a genetic algorithm.

1.Initial population

2.Fitness function

3.Selection

4.Crossover

5.Mutation

##  Purpose of code:
My code gets number of training points and the output value of the target function at those points (considered a one-dimensional function for simplicity).
and by GA returns the formula corresponding to the best tree generated by the algorithm, the amount of merit of the best tree, number of generations, number of calculations of merit, runtime.
